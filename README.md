# Religious convictions and attitudes towards marginalized groups?

How do person's religious convictions effect their attitudes towards marginalized groups in society?

The data used in this visualisation was collected in countries of Eastern Europe.

This visualisation showcases how a person’s religion and the strength of that religious conviction effects the person’s attitudes towards same-sex attracted people, women and their position in society and people of different ethnicities than their own.

In addition it also shows how the gender ratio and average age are related with religious conviction.

To calculate religious conviction I took into account how often person attends religious ceremonies, how often they pray, how strong is their faith and how important they claim their religion is in their life. Despite the lack of belief in God some atheists were as involeved in religion as the people following a religion.

To calculate attitudes towards same-sex attracted people I took into account person’s opinion on same-sex marriage, the moral judgment they ascribe to homosexuality and thier view on acceptance of homosexualty in society.

To calculate attitudes towards women I took into account person’s opinion on abortion, and several views on women’s role in society.

To calculate attitudes towards different ethnicities I took into account person’s opinion on nationalism, immigrants and citizenship.

To see how people’s attitudes change with their religious conviction use the slider in the upper left side of the screen. Height of the bars represents how progressive their attitudes are. The higher the bars represents the more progressive attitudes while the lower the bars represent the more conservative attitudes.

From the visualisation we can see that stronger religious conviction is in fact correlated with more conservative attitudes towards same-sex attracted people and women but less so with conservative attitudes towards people of different ethnicities. It also appears that women and older people are more religious than men and younger people.
